                   Niagara Falls is a group of three waterfalls at the southern end of Niagara Gorge, spanning the border between
                   the province of Ontario in Canada and the state of New York in the United States.  <br/> The largest of the three is 
                   Horseshoe Falls, which straddles the international border of the two countries. It is also known as the Canadian 
                   Falls. The smaller American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls lie within the United States. Bridal Veil Falls is 
                   separated from Horseshoe Falls by Goat Island and from American Falls by Luna Island, with both islands situated in New York.

                    The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the 
                    engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. Locally nicknamed "La dame de fer" 
                    (French for "Iron Lady"), it was constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair. 
                    <br/>
                    The tower is 330 metres (1,083 ft) tall,[6] about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest 
                    structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During its construction, 
                    the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest human-made structure in the world, a 
                    title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first 
                    structure in the world to surpass both the 200-metre and 300-metre mark in height. Due to the addition of a 
                    broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres 
                    (17 ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after 
                    the Millau Viaduct.

                    Mount Kilimanjaro is a dormant volcano located in Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. It has three volcanic cones: 
                    Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. It is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain 
                    above sea level in the world: 5,895 metres (19,341 ft) above sea level and about 4,900 metres (16,100 ft) above 
                    its plateau base. It is the highest volcano in Africa.
                    <br/>
                    Kilimanjaro is the fourth most topographically prominent peak on Earth. It is part of Kilimanjaro National Park 
                    and is a major hiking and climbing destination. Because of its shrinking glaciers and ice fields, which are 
                    projected to disappear between 2025 and 2035, it has been the subject of many scientific studies.
